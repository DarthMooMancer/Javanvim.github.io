### What is Javanvim?
Javanvim is a simple plugin that gives neovim some nice functions while being extremely extensible for Java developers. Are there better plugins? Most likely, however this has simple functions for:

* Creating New Projects
* Creating New Files (With Class Generation)
* Building Files (Currently only Main.java files)
* Running Files (Again only Main.java files)
